You will have 4 pages -
A homepage, where you will advertise your top article(s) and have the ability to navigate to the other pages
Pick three of the following: 
An "Opinion" page that contains at least two articles that are the 'opinions' of made-up columnists.
A "Business" page that contains at least two articles about stocks and/or businesses that can be real or completely fabricated.
An "Entertainment" page that contains at least two articles about either real or fake celebrities/movies etc.
A "Sports" page that contains at least two articles about either real or fake sports news. 
A "Politics" page that contains at least two articles about either real or fake political news.
If there is another type of page you can think of that you want to do, just ask.
You must have navigation between all of the pages, using the <nav> tag. 
All pages must have a header (<nav> should be in here) this can also contain a logo (find one online or make one in paint/photoshop if you like)
The footer for your pages should be comprised of:
A contact section
A copyright section
